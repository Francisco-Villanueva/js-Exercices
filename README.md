# js-Exercices


In this repository, you will find exercises with different levels of difficulty for JavaScript, each one with its corresponding tests to verify if the exercise is correctly solved.

In each folder, you will find a file named "main.js" where you will find the exercises to solve.

Inside each folder, you will need to run the following commands:

-> npm i

-> npm test

Once the tests have been run, make sure that all of them have failed.
